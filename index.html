  This is a workspace for <a href="https://github.com/jimkang/dependency-parser">dependency-parser</a>, a module that parses sentences (in the form of an array of objects representing words) into dependency trees. Try putting a sentence in the field, then hit the buttons to take it through the parsing process.
